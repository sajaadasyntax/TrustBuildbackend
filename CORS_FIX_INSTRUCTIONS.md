# CORS Configuration Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues between the frontend and backend.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated CORS Configuration in `backend/src/index.ts`**:
   - Added more allowed origins, including `https://api.trustbuild.uk`
   - Added support for environment variables API_URL
   - Added logging for CORS requests to help with debugging
   - Expanded the allowed headers to include `X-Requested-With` and `Accept`
   - Added exposedHeaders configuration
   - Set preflightContinue to false and maxAge to 24 hours

2. **Added Global OPTIONS Handler**:
   - Added `app.options('*', cors(corsOptions))` to properly handle preflight requests

3. **Added CORS Test Route**:
   - Added `/api/cors-test` endpoint to test CORS configuration

4. **Modified Helmet Configuration**:
   - Disabled `contentSecurityPolicy` to prevent it from interfering with CORS

5. **Updated Environment Variables**:
   - Added `API_URL` to the environment variables in `env.example`

## How to Apply These Changes

1. **Update your `.env` file**:
   ```
   # Add this line to your .env file
   API_URL=https://api.trustbuild.uk
   ```

2. **Restart the Backend Server**:
   - On Windows: Run `backend/restart.bat`
   - On Unix/macOS: Run `bash backend/restart.sh`

3. **Test CORS Configuration**:
   - Run the CORS test script: `node backend/test-cors.js`
   - Or test manually from your frontend application

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience CORS issues:

1. **Check Server Logs**:
   - Look for the CORS logging messages we added (`ðŸ”’ CORS request from origin`)
   - Make sure the origin is correctly identified and allowed

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` and `API_URL` are correctly set in your `.env` file

3. **Test with Browser Developer Tools**:
   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
   - Go to the Network tab
   - Look for failed requests and check the error details

4. **Try the Debug Route**:
   - Access `https://api.trustbuild.uk/api/cors-test` from your frontend
   - This should return a success message if CORS is working correctly

5. **Check Reverse Proxy Settings**:
   - If you're using Nginx or another reverse proxy, make sure it's not stripping CORS headers
